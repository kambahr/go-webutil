# Web Utility for Golang websites.

## Webutil is a simple, lightweight utility for your Golang website.

It loads, selects the right mime, and caches static (js, css, image,...), and html files.
It also has a place-holder to apply security in order to withhold a file (i.e. a javascript file).

To run the test sample:

- Start a shell window in sample directory.
- go build -o webutilDemo && ./webutilDemo
- Navigate to http://localhost:8005/mypage.html
